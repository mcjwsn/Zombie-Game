# Zombie-Game

Simple JavaScript game implementation -> task from [WDAI Course](https://github.com/mcjwsn/WDAI_Course) with canvas animations, sound effects, responsive design, difficulty levels.
Changing difficulty is a tricky one, you need to lower your processor clock speed and the zombies will slow down.


To play the game:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcwsn/Zombie-Game.git
```
Then you need to open index.html file in your browser.


## How does the game works:
- you get 3 lives,
- hit the zombie by clicking on it,
- every hit erans you 20 points,
- every miss costs 5 points,
- if zombie gets to left side, you will lose a life.
